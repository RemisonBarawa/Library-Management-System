# Library-Management-System
This system will manage books, members, and borrowing records, with proper relationships and constraints. Iâ€™ll create a single, well-commented .sql file that sets up the database, including tables, constraints, and relationships.

## Project Description
This project is a MySQL-based Library Management System designed to manage books, members, and borrowing activities. It includes tables for books, authors, categories, members, and borrowing records, with proper relationships and constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and checks). The system ensures data integrity and supports basic library operations like tracking book availability and borrowing history.

2. Download the `library_management.sql` file from this repository.
3. Open your MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, or the MySQL command line).
4. Run the following command to import the SQL file:
